You're going to want to copy over assets (if you) haven't 
yet.  You can do so with:

  script/generate watchtower_assets

Once you've done that, open up your ApplicationController 
and insert (at the top of the class definition):

  class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
    include Watchtower::ApplicationControllerBase
    
    # etc.
  end
  
If you want to catch exceptions locally, below the include,
insert the method call `force_public_request_handling!`.

Once that's complete, navigate to /watchtower and see the
app running.  If you want to secure Watchtower, create a 
new initializer and extend WatchtowerController, adding any
before_filters you would like.  It's that easy!
